# telegram-unban-bot
Basically, a prank bot. It is designed to instantly unban/unmute someone in a telegram channel if they are deemed "immune" if they are banned specifically by someone who is
"blocked". Specify the users' IDs through the environment variables.

It is not every practical and mostly a joke. A better solution might be to simply unadmin the person in question.

It is designed to be deployed as a lambda function in AWS.
